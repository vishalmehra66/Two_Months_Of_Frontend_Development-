◼HTML Basics
  HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the foundational language for creating web pages. It structures content on the webpage and helps browsers understand 
how to display different types of content like text, images, and links.

1. Structure of an HTML Document:-
  An HTML document follows a specific structure, which provides a foundation for content and styling. 
Here’s an outline of a basic HTML document:-

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Content goes here -->
</body>
</html>

Explanation of Each Part:

<!DOCTYPE html> : Declares the document type and version of HTML (HTML5 in this case).

<html lang="en"> : Root element of the document with a lang attribute defining the language.

<head>: Contains metadata about the page, such as its title and character set.

<meta charset="UTF-8"> : Sets the character encoding to UTF-8, which supports all characters.

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">: Sets the viewport for responsive design.

<title> : Specifies the title displayed on the browser tab.

<body> : Contains the main content of the page, which is visible to users.

2. HTML Tags:-
  HTML tags are elements enclosed within angle brackets (< >) and are used to structure and define different parts of the content. 
Tags typically come in pairs: an opening tag <tagname> and a closing tag </tagname>. Some tags are self-closing.

Examples of Common Tags:-

Headings: <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6> (Levels of headings from most to least important)
Paragraphs: <p> (Defines a paragraph)
Images: <img src="image.jpg" alt="description"> (Displays an image with an alternative text)
Links: <a href="url">link text</a> (Defines a hyperlink to another page)
Lists:
     Unordered List : <ul> <li>Item</li> </ul>
     Ordered List : <ol> <li>Item</li> </ol>

Tables: <table>, <tr>, <th>, <td> (For creating tabular data)

Self-Closing Tags:-
  Some HTML tags are self-closing, meaning they don’t have an ending tag:

<img>: Image tag
<br>: Line break
<hr>: Horizontal line

3. Semantics in HTML:-
  Semantic HTML means using tags that convey the meaning of the content. This helps both browsers and developers understand the purpose of each element. 
Semantics make the content more accessible and improves SEO.

Examples of Semantic Tags:

<header>: Defines the header section, often containing navigation links or introductory information.

<nav>: Represents a section with navigational links.

<main>: Defines the main content area, unique to the page’s central topic.

<section>: Used to group related content within the main area.

<article>: Self-contained piece of content that could be distributed independently (like a blog post).

<footer>: Contains footer content, such as copyright info or links.

Non-semantic tags, like <div> and <span>, don’t convey meaning and are used only for layout.

4. Syntax:-
HTML syntax refers to the way tags are written to ensure browsers interpret them correctly. Here are some key rules:

Tag Names: Always use lowercase for tag names (e.g., <html>, <body>).

Attributes: Additional information added to a tag to customize it. They are always included within the opening tag and written as attribute="value". Common attributes include:
href for links
src for images and scripts
alt for alternative text for images

Nesting: Properly nested tags ensure the document structure is maintained. For example:

<p>This is a <strong>nested</strong> text.</p>
Here, <strong> is nested inside <p>.

Comments: Use comments to annotate the code. Comments are ignored by the browser and look like this:

<!-- This is a comment -->

5. Example of a Simple HTML Document:-
Here’s an example that brings all these concepts together:


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Welcome to My Page</h1>
        <nav>
            <a href="#about">About</a> |
            <a href="#contact">Contact</a>
        </nav>
    </header>

    <main>
        <section id="about">
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm learning frontend development.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="projects">
            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>Here's a list of my projects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Project 1</li>
                <li>Project 2</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
    </main>

    <footer>
        <p>&copy; 2024 My Name</p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>

This example demonstrates a semantic HTML structure with a header, navigation, main content, sections, and a footer.
