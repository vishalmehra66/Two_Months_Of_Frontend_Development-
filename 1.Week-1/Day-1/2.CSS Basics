◼CSS Basics:-
  CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages. It controls the appearance of HTML elements, 
enabling developers to create visually appealing and responsive designs.

1. CSS Selectors:-
CSS selectors are used to target HTML elements for styling. They are one of the core components of CSS 
and can vary from simple element names to more complex selectors for specific elements or groups.

Types of Selectors:-

Universal Selector (*): Targets all elements on the page.

* {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}

Element Selector: Targets all elements of a specific type, such as <p>, <h1>, or <div>.

p {
    color: blue;
}

Class Selector (.classname): Targets elements with a specific class attribute. Classes are reusable, so the same class can be used on multiple elements.

.highlight {
    background-color: yellow;
}

ID Selector (#idname): Targets a specific element with an id attribute. IDs should be unique on a page.

#header {
    text-align: center;
}

Attribute Selector: Selects elements based on an attribute. This is useful for targeting specific elements based on their attributes.

input[type="text"] {
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
}

Descendant Selector (ancestor descendant): Selects elements nested within a specified parent.

div p {
    font-size: 14px;
}

Pseudo-classes: Apply styles to elements based on their state, like :hover, :focus, or :nth-child.

a:hover {
    color: red;
}

2. CSS Properties:-
CSS properties define the specific styling applied to selected elements. Each property is paired with a value, creating a style rule that the browser can apply to elements.

Common CSS Properties:-

Color and Background

color: Sets the color of text.

h1 {
    color: #333;
}

background-color: Sets the background color of an element.

.box {
    background-color: lightblue;
}

Text and Font

font-size: Sets the size of the font.

p {
    font-size: 16px;
}

font-family: Specifies the typeface for the text.

body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

text-align: Aligns text within an element (e.g., left, center, right).

h1 {
    text-align: center;
}

Spacing

margin: Sets the space outside the element.

h2 {
    margin: 20px;
}
padding: Sets the space inside the element.

.container {
    padding: 15px;
}

Border and Outline

border: Sets the border around an element (thickness, style, color).

.box {
    border: 2px solid black;
}

Box Model Properties
width and height: Sets the width and height of an element.

.card {
    width: 300px;
    height: 200px;
}

3. CSS Values
CSS values are assigned to properties and dictate the visual effect. Values can be specific measurements, colors, or special keywords depending on the property.

Common CSS Values-

Color Values: Colors can be represented in various ways, such as hex codes, RGB, or predefined color names.
color: #ff5733;
color: rgb(255, 87, 51);
color: blue;

Length Units:

Absolute Units (e.g., px, cm, mm, in): Specific, fixed measurements. Commonly, px (pixels) is used.
padding: 10px;

Relative Units (e.g., em, rem, %, vw, vh): Relative to other properties, like the parent or viewport size.
em is relative to the font size of the parent.
rem is relative to the font size of the root element (html).
font-size: 2em;
width: 50%;

Percentage Values: Values in percentages are relative to the parent element's dimensions.
width: 100%;

Keywords: Certain properties use keywords for specific effects, such as auto, none, inherit.

auto: Automatically adjusts the value based on other elements or layout rules.
inherit: Inherits the value from the parent element.

display: none;
margin: auto;

Special Functional Values:-

calc(): Allows calculations within CSS, making it more flexible.

width: calc(100% - 20px);
rgba(): Sets color with transparency (alpha channel).

background-color: rgba(255, 87, 51, 0.5);

◻Putting It All Together:-
Here’s an example CSS rule to illustrate selectors, properties, and values in action:

/* Selects all paragraphs within a class "container" and sets their styling */
.container p {
    color: #333;
    font-size: 1.2em;
    line-height: 1.5;
    padding: 10px 15px;
    background-color: #f4f4f4;
    border: 1px solid #ddd;
    margin: 20px auto;
}

Explanation:
Selector: .container p targets all paragraphs inside elements with the class .container.
Properties and Values: Each CSS property (color, font-size, etc.) has an assigned value that defines its effect on the element’s appearance.

  This overview covers the essential concepts for starting with CSS and learning how to style HTML elements effectively. With this foundation, 
you can build visually engaging web pages and control their layout.
